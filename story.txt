Once a man named barry went to the store. It was just a normal day, nothing extraordinary, until suddenly, a woman dropped her bag all the way across the store, and Barry somehow caught it in a flash! It was this day that Barry discovered that he had super speed; he was the fastest man on Earth. 
However, he was not the only one with this ability. As he learned about this power, in another dimension a criminal named Larry was robbing a bank. As he was grabbing all the cash, the cops arrived and started shooting at him. Thinking that he was going to get hit, in a flash he dodged all the bullets and ended up at his home with all the cash. He also discovered his super fast ability and now wanted to steal more banks.
